/* Write a program that reads in a product computation of the
 following form:
 N0 * N1 * N2 * N3 * â€¦ * Nn =
 and returns the product of the given ints,
 along with the number of terms in the product.
 Note that you donâ€™t know how many integer values the user
 will enter until they enter an equal sign (=).
 Example:
 Please enter a product to be computed, followed by an = sign.
 : 4 * 56 * 2 * 7 * 4 =
 The product of the 5 numbers entered is 12544

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    
// initialization
cout << "Enter product like 2 * 3 * 4 = " << endl << ": ";

int product = 1;
int numValues = 0; // counts number of valid numbers entered
int number;
char oper;

while (oper != '=') {
// read next pair
cin >> number >> oper;

product = product * number;
numValues = numValues + 1;
}

cout << "The product of the " << numValues
 << " entered is " << product << endl;
