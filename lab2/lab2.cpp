int main()

    //Step 1: Computer chooses a random number between 0 and 100
    //Step 2: User is asked to guess a number between said numbers
    //Step 3: If user guesses correct number, congratulate user and add 10 points
    //Step 4: If user guess is incorect subract 1 point from 10 for each incorrect guess and state whether actual number is higher or lower
    //Step 5: If user does not get the number correct after 10 tries, reveal correct number and start over from step one
